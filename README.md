- **Notes**  
  - Dates were standardized to `YYYY-MM-DD`.  
  - Opponent names were normalized to match across datasets. 
  - Row counts were validated against official season totals.
  - 2020 MLS season was shortened due to COVID (23 matches instead of 34) and included repeat fixtures (LAFC vs LA Galaxy three times).
  - Only MLS regular season + playoff matches included (Velaâ€™s 2024 cameo excluded).
  - Non-MLS competitions (US Open Cup, CCL, friendlies) were excluded from the cleaned dataset to focus the analysis on MLS results only.
